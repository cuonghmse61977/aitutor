# Aitutor Project

This project uses CrewAI, Jupyter, and Ollama deepseekv2:1.6b to solve math problems. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- CrewAI
- Jupyter
- Ollama deepseekv2:1.6b

## Setup

1. **Install Python 3.12**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install CrewAI**: Follow the installation instructions on the [CrewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/).

3. **Install Jupyter**: You can install Jupyter using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install jupyter
   ```

4. **Install Ollama deepseekv2:1.6b**: Follow the installation instructions provided by Ollama.

## Running the Project

1. **Add/Edit `file.csv`**: Ensure that `file.csv` is in the correct format required by the project.

2. **Run `data_processing.ipynb`**: Open the Jupyter notebook `data_processing.ipynb` and run all cells to generate the `output.json` file.

3. **Edit `main.py`**: Update the path of method run `run_and_save_to_csv` `training_set.json` to `output.json` in `main.py`.

4. **Run `main.py`**: Execute the `main.py` script to get the math problem results.

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the project:

1. Add or edit `file.csv` with the correct format.
2. Open Jupyter and run `data_processing.ipynb` to generate `output.json`.
3. Edit `main.py` to set the path of method run `run_and_save_to_csv` `training_set.json` to `output.json`.
4. Run `main.py` to get the results.

```sh
python main.py
```
